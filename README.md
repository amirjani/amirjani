### Hey! I'm [@Amir__Jani](https://twitter.com/amir__jani) (Amirhossein Jani) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Iran. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·

I have been building APIs and tools with different teams and organizations.

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–
